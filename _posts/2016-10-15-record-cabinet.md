I have always loved building and fixing things but I had never embarked on such an ambitious project. I had my eyes set on doing a woodworking project because I was interested in learning some new techniques at [Tech Shop](http://www.techshop.ws/arlington.html) and because I was running out of places to put my records. Record storage is pretty much split into two categories - looks about as cheap as you paid for it to exorbitant. If I was going to sink a bunch of money into storage, I wanted to learn something in the process.

Since then, I am now very interested in woodworking and looking forward to starting a new project. Even though this one took about 6 months to complete, after many breaks in between, it is now done. Despite alterations to the plan and minimizing the scope to get it done, I am still very proud of how my project turned out. The cabinet is built out of American Cherry that I purchased from a lumber yard in Virginia and finished in a tung oil/citrus solvent finish. I also created the CAD drawing in SketchUp. The boards were rough from being cut at the mill and in long pieces, so I started pretty much from square one. See images below.
