title: Margins & Sticky Footer
description: CSS and HTML are much harder than they seem
---

The blog did not seem to look right before so I added margins. CSS & HTML are one of the first semi-coding languages I learned (I say semi because I've heard people not even consider them coding languages) but I am still uneasy on the "best" ways to to do certain things. That has brought up this issue with the footer - I want a footer but have yet to find the best way. Most links point to *Sticky Footer* so I may try that.

More info on Sticky Footer: [link](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/sticky-footer/). There are about a million of them out there by the same name, this is just one.

Thirdly, I want to add an image to the top of the blog-index page. That will allow for the eye to find the center and not think the titles and header are off-center. Still trying to think of a better way to do this since i've seen the feather done before and its kind of corny.
