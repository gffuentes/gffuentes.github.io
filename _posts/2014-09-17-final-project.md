excerpt: One of my GA teachers, Tedi Konda, could not stress enough to always write down the different user stories (SCRUM style) of what your app will do before actually writing any bit of code.

One of my GA teachers, Tedi Konda, could not stress enough to always write down the different user stories (SCRUM style) of what your app will do before actually writing any bit of code. So here is where I will do that. Let this post serve as just a sneak peak at what is to come from my final project.
<br><br>
I also want to get in the habit of starting my READMEs this way, so this will be the beginnings of that as well.

1. User should be able to login to their account
2. User should be able to create new rooms
3. User should be able to add a song to a queue in a room from multiple music sources
4. User should be able to start or stop the queue from being played on their own computer
5. User should only be able to add to a queue when logged in
6. User should only be able to play a queue when logged in
7. User should be able to see all currently active rooms and the song queues in each when not logged in
8. Author should be able to destroy a room permanently
9. Non logged in and logged in Users should be able to insert text into the queue (plain text, chatroom message style) into any, non empty room
10. Music should stop playing when queue ends.
11. User should be able to paste in URLs to add to the queue.
12. (possibly phase 2?) User should be able to search for songs, genres, playlist, whatever the APIs allow for and add to the queue - wll probably need some performance solution for this

Next up will be some make shift wire frames of each view - and then I will begin the creation. I still need a name...
