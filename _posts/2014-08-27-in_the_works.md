The biggest struggle, currently, is thinking of content. Typical websites always have a sort of summary of different features or some accolades on the homepage but there is not much precedent when it comes to online/virtual résumé's. I want to take a kind of strange approach, which I may end up modifying later, where I put some of the key things that motivate me on a day to day basis. I sort of went back and forth on how these were worded. I was between using the first person or using active suggestion type commands almost, but that seemed too fortune cookie advice like. I've settled on a more passive voice which I think works, for now.

Some other things I need to include:

1. General Skills like BEWD and MySql etc
2. My relevant interests
3. What I hope to learn in the future
4. My experience at my latest job
5. Relevant work
6. How this site was built

I also need images. Lots of images. I'm loving the turtle favicon though...

Its not much now, but for the sake of documenting, below are screenshots:
