After struggling to modify all this CSS and HTML to make a sticky footer, I realized [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) actually has one of its [own](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/sticky-footer/). After exploring how it worked, I actually figured out my struggle with Bootstrap's CSS was that I was not using it correctly.
<br /><br />
Not that there is a wrong way to use it since they highley encourage you to customize (which my site, as it stands, is pretty much a copy of most of their examples in one) but on my first attempt to create the front end for this site, I struggled to edit the main bootsrap CSS file. I even thought to myself why they would even include a minifyed version, which would make it even harder to edit. However, when I started looking at the Source Code for the sticky footer, I saw they created a seperate CSS file for the stylings of the footer.
<br /><br />
So I decided to start over. I cleaned everything up. I added back in the minifyed Bootstrap CSS and added the sticky footer and a new header, each with their own css. I also changed the view of the blog and the posts by using another Bootstrap template called [Bootstrap Blog](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/).
<br /><br />
Despite how things started, I think things are now looking good.

Here is my footer HTML and CSS if you care to take a look:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="footer">
  <div class="container">
    <p class="text-muted">
    	<h id='gfoot'>Hosted by<a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">
    	<img class='github' src="{{ site.url }}/assets/GitHub_Logo.png"></a></img></h>
    	<br>
    	<a href='/contact.html'>Contact Me</a>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight css %}
/* Sticky footer styles
-------------------------------------------------- */
html {
  position: relative;
  min-height: 100%;
}
body {
  /* Margin bottom by footer height */
  margin-bottom: 60px;
}
.footer {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  /* Set the fixed height of the footer here */
  height: 65px;
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}


/* Custom page CSS
-------------------------------------------------- */
/* Not required for template or sticky footer method. */

.footer .container {
  width:100%;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 12px 0;
}
.footer .container p {
  margin-bottom: 0px;
}
/*For image weirdness with footer*/
#gfoot img {
  margin-left:0px;
  height:27px;
}
{% endhighlight %}
