After struggling to modify all this CSS and HTML to make a sticky footer, I realized [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) actually has one of its [own](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/sticky-footer/). After exploring how it worked, I actually figured out my struggle with Bootstrap's CSS was that I was not using it correctly.
<br /><br />
Not that there is a wrong way to use it since they highley encourage you to customize (which my site, as it stands, is pretty much a copy of most of their examples in one) but on my first attempt to create the front end for this site, I struggled to edit the main bootsrap CSS file. I even thought to myself why they would even include a minifyed version, which would make it even harder to edit. However, when I started looking at the Source Code for the sticky footer, I saw they created a seperate CSS file for the stylings of the footer.
<br /><br />
So I decided to start over. I cleaned everything up. I added back in the minifyed Bootstrap CSS and added the sticky footer and a new header, each with their own css. I also changed the view of the blog and the posts by using another Bootstrap template called [Bootstrap Blog](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/).

Despite how things started, I think things are now looking good.
