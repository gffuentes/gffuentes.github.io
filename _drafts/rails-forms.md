title: Rails Forms Beginnings
description: What GA and RoR.org has taught me so far about forms. (spoiler: lots to remember making it pretty hard...)
---
At GA (and from others) I have always been told:

> Use documentation and stack overflow! You don't need to memorize!

With learning forms though and HTTP requests, I have realized although I don't need to necessarily memorize all the syntax, I do need to remember what all the moving parts are and what they are doing.
<br><br>
So I want the following blog post to try to better show how forms work (as per GA and [RoR.org](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#configuration-gotchas)) and also to better lay things out for myself to hopefully help better conceptualize these learnings.
