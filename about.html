		<h2>Venga<br><small>Startup Career</small></h2>
		<p class="lead">Above all else, Venga has been a pivotal career growing experience. In my three positions there, I gained an incredible amount of knowledge but most importantly an inspiration to always keep learning more. There I was able to pickup MySql, MongoDB, Rails, Git, SVN and countless more, none of which I had even heard of before my carreer at Venga began. </p><hr class="featurette-divider">

		<h2>General Assembly<br><small>Back End Web Development (BEWD)</small></h2>
		<p class="lead">Although I was not new to programming languages, my only knowledge was from the many different things I had already picked up at Venga. With this more formal learning, I was able to connect many of the dots I had already established previously and gain the tools I needed to overcome the hump of the coding learning curve.<br><br> See <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> for a rundown of what I worked on.</p><hr class="featurette-divider">

		<h2>James Madison University<br><small>Education: '09 to '13</small></h2>
		<p class="lead">At JMU, I developed the foundation for my small business background by concentrating in Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship. School provided a more holistic view of the realities of small business allowing for a headstart to a successful career at Venga.</p><hr class="featurette-divider">
